        3.1- The first line contains this dimensions of the tiles (everything is a square)
        3.2- On the next lines, draw you level using the corresponding symbols:
            x -> an obstacle
            s -> a strawberry (collectible)
            p -> player starting position
            e -> end of the level
    4- open the file labeled "LevelNames.txt"
    5- This file contains the level name and its decritption separated by a coma where each line equals a level, so add a name and description for the new level
